What is Github? (https://www.gangboard.com/blog/what-is-github)

# About the Article
I chose to go old school with this assignment! This article is the first article
that I found really helpful to introduce Git and Github to me. The motivation was
to find an article that showed me what Github was and why people use it! When I 
was new to Github, I wanted to know why this was the system that everyone used 
and not something else. 
I think this article is really good because it uses really simple language to 
explain to a beginner what this platform is and what advantages it has. It does 
not include any complicated git commands and simply introduces the concept. I 
bookmarked it as a ever-present north star about Git.

Hello there. I read the article and it is a very simple introduction to GitHub.
I am fairly new to GitHub; my first exposure to git was very limited usage of it
in highschool, but I actually never understood what it was for, despite the fact
that I used it. Now that two of my courses (and probably all the ones I'll take
in the future) require using it, I've learned a bit more about it but this article
is a good refresher and beginner-friendly welcome to github.
