What is Github? (https://www.gangboard.com/blog/what-is-github)

# About the Article
I chose to go old school with this assignment! This article is the first article
that I found really helpful to introduce Git and Github to me. The motivation was
to find an article that showed me what Github was and why people use it! When I 
was new to Github, I wanted to know why this was the system that everyone used 
and not something else. 
I think this article is really good because it uses really simple language to 
explain to a beginner what this platform is and what advantages it has. It does 
not include any complicated git commands and simply introduces the concept. I 
bookmarked it as a ever-present north star about Git.
